#Every year, B Lab highlights the Certified B Corporations that go above and beyond in their pursuit of positive impact. All B Corporations take the B Impact Assessment and meet verified score requirements to become certified. In the assessment, companies are evaluated on their impact on the environment, their workers, their customers, and their communities; they also all meet the highest standards of accountability and transparency. Companies featured in the "Best for the World" list score in the top 10% of the B Corp community in each of seven categoriesâ€”they are the top performers in an already exceptional group of businesses.
